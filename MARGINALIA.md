It took Wassily Kandinsky 10 years for transitioning "from the apocalyptic emotion of Composition VII to the geometric rhythm of Composition VIII." [1] (which is used as the book cover) 

Be patient!

### Understanding the "model"

The inner red circle represents China - 中國. 

According to a Korean source (translated with Google translator):
> On this map, trees are drawn to indicate the directions of the northeast, west, and north. Continents and coastlines are shown with thin lines, and many names of countries are also written. [2]

Quoting another source:
> This mid-1700s Chinese map of the world features an inner continent surrounded by a sea holding fantasy lands and mountains, themselves surrounded by a fictional outer ring of land. The trees to the far east and west mark the areas from which the sun and moon were assumed to rise and set. Data on the mythical lands was drawn from the Shanhai jing, a collection of Chinese myths and fables dating back to the 4th century B.C. [3]
